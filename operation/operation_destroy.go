Coach will attempt to remove any built images for target nodes.  A node is
considered "buildable" if it has a Build: definition.

SYNTAX:
	$/> coach {targets} destroy

	{targets} what target nodes the operation should process ($/> coach help targets)

ACCESS:
	- this opertion will only process nodes with "build" access.  This includes only nodes with the Build: settings declared.

NOTE:
	- Coach will try not to remove an image for a node that does not build, which is the common case for nodes with an image, but no build setting.  This prevents deleting shared images that are not build targets.
