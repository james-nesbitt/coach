Coach will attempt to build a new docker image, for each target node that has a build setting.

The operation will look for a Build: setting inside the node, and try to find a matching Dockerfile at the suggested path.  The path can be relative to the project root, or absolute.

SYNTAX:
	$/> coach {targets} build

	{targets} what target nodes the operation should process ($/> coach help targets)

ACCESS:
	- this operation processes only nodes with the "build" access.  This includes only nodes with a Build: setting.

NOTES:
- a node that can be built should have a Build: setting, which points to a project path that contains the Dockerfile.
- while {targets} globally can specify particular node instances, that information is ignored for this operation, as images are built for all instances of a node.
