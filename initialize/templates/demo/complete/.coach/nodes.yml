# Project nodes
#
# A string map of node configurations, each entry is a node, which 
# corresponds to a set of containers based on a single image.  the
# nodes have different types, an different purposes:
#
# Nodes: 
#   Each element in the yml file is a keyed configuration to configure
#   a single coach node, which is any number of docker containers
#   that use a single build/image.  The nodes can be just used to 
#   build images, or can be used to store data, run services or run
#   commands.  A node can use multiple containers to provide scaling
#   services, or alternate services.
#
# Types:
#   - build: only used for building images, let's you build a base 
#        image for other nodes
#   - volume: non-running containers meant to hold files that are 
#        shared with other nodes
#   - service: a node with containers that get started and stopped
#   - command: a node that uses disposable containers to run commands
#        inside an environment
#
# Instances:
#   Nodes can have multiple containers called instances. The instances
#   setting tells coach how to treat the node instances:
#   - scale: allow numeric instances, and allow the scale operation 
#        to spin up new instanes.
#   - fixed: if you provide a string list of instances, then they 
#         can be started and stopped by name.
#   - temporary: instances started are removed when stopped.  For example
#         command containers are considered temporary.
#
#   Multiple instances are complex, especially when it comes to linking
#   Nodes together.  If one node is linked to another, either by Link,
#   or VolumesFrom, then coach tries to link matching instance names
#   possible (or you can user node:all to link to all)
#
# Tokens:
#
#  Tokens can be used for string substitution in this file.  Tokens can come
#  from the conf.yml, or from the secrets.yml (or from the users secrets.)
#  Tokens are substituted using a "%" prefix, before the YML is parsed, so
#  you may need to wrap tokenized settings in "quotes" when using them.
#
#  The following tokens are available:
#
#    - anything from the tokens section of the conf.yml
#    - anything from the project or user secrets.yml
#    
#    - the project name is accessible using %PROJECT
#    - any path value is accessible using %PATH_UPPERCASEPATHKEY
#    - multi-instance nodes can access the intance name as %INSTANCE
#
# Coach configuration:
#
#   - Type: You can define the node type (or it will default to service)
#   - Build: You can assign a Build path, which will be used to build a local
#        image for the node.  If you also define an image then that
#        is used for the image name.  If the path is relative, then it
#        is considered relative inside the .coach/ folder.
#   - Instances: a string list of instance names, or the keyword temporary
#        or the keyword scaled, followed by the integer values for initial
#        and maximum number of running containers
#        e.g.:
#           Instances: first second third
#           Instances: temporary
#           Instances: scaled 3 9
#
# Docker remote API Configurations:
#
#   The two principle parts of the configuration for a node are the 
#   Config and Host settings.
#   These wrap the client config and can use any of it's keys, which 
#   gives access to pretty much all of the docker remote API settings.
#
#   - Config : the dockerclient config element used define the internals
#        of a container.  
#        https://github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/blob/master/container.go#L200
#   - Host : the dockerclient config element used to define the relationship
#        between the container and it's host.
#        https://github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/blob/master/container.go#L472

# A volume container to deliver the web root as READ-ONLY
#
# Using a container to hold source, even if it just locally binded source, is
# a good idea, because it replicates what a production service would do.  It would
# have source copied/exported/retrieved in, and make it available in the same way
#
# The container has
#  - www : the Read-Only web root (not yet read only)
#  - assets : a Read-Write set of assets for the application
#  - backup : a place for the application to dump archives and backups
#
# @note that the relational path between the bound paths remains the same
#  inside the container as it is locally, which allows for relative sym-links
