  HELP: Script: shell

  The shell tool is a script based docker run, which often behaves 
  better than running terminal applications through the docker remote
  API.

  This script runs the jamesnesbitt/wunder-developershell image, and
  links to all needed services, and pulls volumes as needed.

  The image the runs a zsh shell, using the "app" user, to prevent any
  permission issues.

  USAGE:

      $/> coach tool shell
