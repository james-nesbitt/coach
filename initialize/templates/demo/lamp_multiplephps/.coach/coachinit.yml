    # COACH DEMO: Lamp with multiple PHP backends

    This coach demo provides an enhanced LAMP stack:

    - DB service using jamesnesbitt/wunder-mariadb

    - 3 fpm services, that connect a standard to a different
      php version.  All php versions point to the same DB
      container, and use a separate nginx host.
        - php56fpm : from centos REMI
        - php7fpm : from REMI-7
        - hhvm : from EPEL I think

    - 1 master nginx server that has three server{} settings
      to point to each of the PHP FPMs using wildcarded URLS
        - php56.* -> the php56 fpm server
        - php7.* -> the php7 fpm server
        - hhvm.* -> the hhvm server

    @NOTE you may have to do some DNS/hosts magic to get these
    DNS entries to resolve

    This should produce 3 parrallel nginx services that
    all point to the same source, which can be used for
    parrallel testing.

    To incorporate source, the source code from /app/source
    is mapped into a "source" container, which is used in
    the nginx and fpm containers.

    The Database is un-initialized, but an optional init
    build for a db has been included, and you can switch to
    it by removing the db node, and uncommenting the custom
    db node.

    All of the suggested images in this project are based on
    the wunder-base concept, which is used to provide a commong
    /app project folder, and similar users/OS, to keep access
    privileges working better.
    The builds are all CentOS7, EPEL and often REMI based builds.

    # Getting Started:

      You already did this:

        #/> coach init demo lamp_multiplephp

      Now just do this:

        $/> coach up

      This should:

        - download some images
        - build any local images that were defined
        - create a source container which will map ./app/source to /app/www/active

        - start nginx containers, and fpm containers and a db container

      You can access the different http servers directly, or set
      different port numbers for each

    # Day to day use

    ## starting and stopping

        $/> coach stop
        $/> coach start

    ## coach targets

      You can target coach at only certain nodes using targets

        $/> coach @www stop

        $/> coach @php56 @php7 @hhvm start

    ## rebuild any containers

      1. stop any running containers

        $/> coach stop

      2. remove and created containers

        $/> coach remove

      3. recreate and containers

        $/> coach create

      4. start the new containers

        $/> coach start

    # A volume container to hold source
    #
    # Using a conmtainer to hold source, even if it just locally binded source, is
    # a good idea, because it replicates what a production service would do.  It would
    # have source copied/exported/retrieved in, and make it available in the same way

    # WWW service
    #
    # An nginx service, that handles http requests, and passes PHP parsing off to 
    # the fpm node.  This node has some custom configurations to try to get it
    # to respond to different URLs appropriately
    #
    # This nginx server handles URLS as follows:
    #   php56.* => goes to the php56 fpm
    #   php7.* => goes to the php7 fpm
    #   hhvm.* => goes to the hhvm fpm
    #
    # @note you may need to do some DNS magic to get your machine to point to
    #  the www container for all three URLs, but that is your business.
    #
    # @note that this container binds to the host port for 8080, but can still be 
    #   resolved by pointing to port 80 on the container IP
    # @note that if you are using DNSDOCK, the DNSDOCK_ALIAS will help you browser to the service
    # @note https is an option if you set up the image properly.

    nginx conf, to allow for 3 server{} listeners, 1 for each fpm service.
