# A volume container to hold source which can be shared as Read Only
#
# Using a conmtainer to hold source, even if it just locally binded source, is
# a good idea, because it replicates what a production service would do.  It would
# have source copied/exported/retrieved in, and make it available in the same way
#
source:
  Type: volume

  Docker:
    Config:
      Image: jamesnesbitt/wunder-base # RUn from a standard base image

# A volume container to hold source which can be shared as Read-Write
#
# @note that this container has volumes that might map on top of the 
#   source container, to provide readable assets inside the read-only
#   source code.

# Database service
#
# This container uses a local build to extend a base db, adding in a database "app" and changing
# the root user password
# 
# @see ./coach/docker/db/Dockerfile
#
# This node needs building !  $/> coach build

###
# FPM service
#
# This node implements a standard PHP-FPM service, which you can connect to over
# TCP/IP.  The node has access to the source via the source container, and the db
# using a docker link (accessible over TCP/IP at db.app)
#
# There are alternative PHP images that you could try, to test out HHVM or PHP7
# But note that if you switch, you have to recreate the container.
#
# Note that the WWW node needs this container
#

  Type: service

###
# WWW service
#
# An nginx service, that handles http requests, and passes PHP parsing off to 
# the fpm node.  This node has some custom configurations to try to get it
# to respond to different URLs appropriately
#
# @note that this container binds to the host port for 8080, but can still be 
#   resolved by pointing to port 80 on the container IP
# @note that if you are using DNSDOCK, the DNSDOCK_ALIAS will help you browser to the service
# @note https is an option if you set up the image properly.

#
# DEVELOPER NODES
#
# Developer containers tend to connect to the DB, and map in 
# source as read-write, along with assets, and some additional
# files and folder to configure relevant tools.
#
# Commonly you map in:
#  - your user .ssh to get ... ssh access
#  - drush and console configurations
#  - git and github so that you can use you user tokens and settings
#

###
# Command configuration and caches
#
# This is a volume container into which you can map files 
# that are used to configure developer tools, but which you
# may not want to have available in your www and fpm containers
