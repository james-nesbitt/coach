    # COACH DEMO: Drupal8 w/ composer

    This coach demo provides a Drupal 8 site, using composer and
    the drupal-project composer repo.  The Drupal source code is
    retrieved from git, so composer will need to be run before
    using Drupal, but instructions below should cover that.

    The demo provides the following:

    - standalone nginx and php7 fpm containers
    - a standalone db server, with an empty db (mysql://app:app@db.app/app)
    - read-only source for fpm (but read-write in dev containers)
    - writeable assets, mapped directly into the sites default paths (no sym-links required)
    - command containers for composer/console/drush

    - a host mounted backup folder that can be used for drush dumps

    The database is empty, but you can either include provisioning
    in the custom DB build, or you can install into it.

    There is a writeable settings.local.php in the app/drupal
    folder, but you will have to play around to get settings.php
    writeable (just duplicate what I did for the local settings)

    All of the suggested images in this project are based on
    the wunder-base concept, which is used to provide a commong
    /app project folder, and similar users/OS, to keep access
    privileges working better.
    The builds are all CentOS7, EPEL and often REMI based builds.

    # Getting Started:

      You already did this:

        #/> coach init demo drupal8

      Now just do this:

        $/> coach up

      This should:

        - download some images
        - build any local images that were defined
        - create a source container which will map ./app/source to /app/www/active

        - start an nginx container, and fpm container and a db container

      You should then have

        - http access at host:8080, or directly on the container
        - the http should point to the source code in /app/source

      As Drupal8 needs composer to run, you will need to use the composer command
      container to do the initial installs

        $/> coach @composer run update
        $/> coach @composer run install

    # Day to day use

    ## starting and stopping

        $/> coach stop
        $/> coach start

    ## starting a specific container

      - start a specific node

        $/> coach @www start

      - start all service nodes

        $/> coach %service start

    ## rebuild any containers

      @NOTE that you will lose your DB contents if you don not export them

      1. stop any running containers

        $/> coach stop

      2. remove and created containers

        $/> coach remove

      3. recreate and containers

        $/> coach create

      4. start the new containers

        $/> coach start

    # Alterations that you should make

    ## Installable

    If you can get drush to install, it uses the source as read-write
    so it could avoid any problems.

    You could add a writeable settings.php on top of the read-only
    source, to allow a Drupal install.  Really this should not be
    necessary, as there are plenty of patches out there to allow
    Drupal to be installed if the settings.php give a DB connection
    already.

    You can add a mount to the source container:

      Config:
        Volumes:
          "/app/project/web/sites/default/settings.php": {}

    But you will have to copy the default.settings.php into that new
    file

    ## Custom DB

    You could alter the DB build to include an sql dump

    # DB Docker Build

    This is a Docker build that can optionally be used for building a custom Database
    image for the local project.

    To use this build, add "docker/db" (the path inside the .coach folder) to an node,
    and then you can use "$/> docker build" to build all node images

    # DEMO Drupal 8

    ## /app/drupal-project

    Drupal 8 source as provided by the drupalproject

    https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project.git

    This source is cloned during project init, so it is a
    clean copy.  You will probably want to remote the git
    remote, and make some changes

    Note that many of the paths in the source are mapped
    over in the containers, so that the assets paths can 
    be mapped over the source code.  this allows source 
    to be mounted as read-only, for security.

    # /app/assets/

    ## /app/assets/files

    The two folders inside this path will be mounted into
    containers for the sites/default public and private 
    files paths.

    # /app/settings

    Various cli app configurations

    # /app/settings/console

    Configurations for the Drupal console command container

    # /app/settings/drush

    Configurations and aliases for drush

    # /app/settings/settings.local.php

    An example for how to mount a local file over the source
    code, this keeps the local settings file out of the source code

    # /app/settings/services.local.yml

    An example for how to mount a local services file over the source
    code, this keeps the local services file out of the source code

    # /app/backups

    Mounted into the containers as an optional destination for
    backup and archive dumping.
