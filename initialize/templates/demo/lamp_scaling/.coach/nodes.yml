# Project nodes
#
# A string map of node configurations, each entry is a node, which 
# corresponds to a set of containers based on a single image.  the
# nodes have different types, an different purposes:
#
# Instances
#
# Note that while the source and db nodes will have single containers,
# the www and fpm nodes will run somewhere between 3 and 9 containers
# The www and fpm containers will try to correspond their links, but
# all fpm containers will connect to the same DB and source containers
#

###
# A volume container to hold source
#
# Using a conmtainer to hold source, even if it just locally binded source, is
# a good idea, because it replicates what a production service would do.  It would
# have source copied/exported/retrieved in, and make it available in the same way
#
source:
  Type: volume

  Docker: 
    Config:
      Image: jamesnesbitt/wunder-base # RUn from a standard base image
    Host:
      Binds:
        - "app/source:/app/www/active" # map the local source folder, into where the nginx/fpm expect the web root

###
# Database service
#
# This container is a base DB image with no existing DB, nor access.  Consider 
# using a local build, to extend a base DB image, adding in a db, adding a user
# and setting exactly what access credentials that you want
#
db:
  Type: service

  Docker:
    Config:
      Image: jamesnesbitt/wunder-mariadb  # this base db image has no running db, user, access yet

###
# FPM service
#
# This node implements a scaling number of PHP7 FPM services from the same
# image, running concurrently.
#
# Each instance will connect to the same single DB container.
#
fpm:
  Type: service

  Scale:
    Initial: 3
    Maximum: 9

  Docker:
    Config:
      Image: jamesnesbitt/wunder-php7fpm     # The FPM delivers the latest PHP7

    Host:
      Links:
        - db:db.app # make the db container available as db.app
      VolumesFrom:
        - source  # map in all volumes from the source container

###
# WWW service
#
# A scaling nginx node, that offers multiple instances of the same
# image running concurrently.
#
# Each instance expects to have a matching FPM instance to link to
# and will try to link to the instance with the matching instance id
#
# @note instance IDs are integer values
# @note the container hostname will include the instance
