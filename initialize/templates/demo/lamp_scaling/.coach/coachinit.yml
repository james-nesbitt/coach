    # COACH DEMO: Scaling LAMP

    This coach demo provides a scaling LAMP stack:

    - a single DB service using jamesnesbitt/wunder-mariadb

    - a scaling set of nginx/fpm pairs, starting at 3
      but scaling up to 9 instances.

      @these come in pairs to allow scaling http access, but
        DNS should work if you do some local magic.

    To incorporate source, the source code from /app/source
    is mapped into a "source" container, which is used in
    the nginx and fpm containers.

    The Database is un-initialized, but an optional init
    build for a db has been included, and you can switch to
    it by removing the db node, and uncommenting the custom
    db node.

    All of the suggested images in this project are based on
    the wunder-base concept, which is used to provide a commong
    /app project folder, and similar users/OS, to keep access
    privileges working better.
    The builds are all CentOS7, EPEL and often REMI based builds.

    # Getting Started:

      You already did this:

        #/> coach init demo lamp_scaling

      Now just do this:

        $/> coach up

      This should:

        - download some images
        - build any local images that were defined
        - create a source container which will map ./app/source to /app/www/active

        - start some nginx containers, and  some fpm containers and a single db container

      You should then have

        - http access to all nginx services by directly pointing to the container

    # Day to day use

    ## starting and stopping

        $/> coach stop
        $/> coach start

    ## starting and stopping more instances

      Use the scale operation to start additional instances:

        $/> coach scale up

      And the same operation to scale down

        $/> coach scale down

    ## starting a specific container

      - start a specific node

        $/> coach @www start

      - start all service nodes

        $/> coach %service start

    ## rebuild any containers

      1. stop any running containers

        $/> coach stop

      2. remove and created containers

        $/> coach remove

      3. recreate and containers

        $/> coach create

      4. start the new containers

        $/> coach start

    # Project nodes
    #
    # A string map of node configurations, each entry is a node, which 
    # corresponds to a set of containers based on a single image.  the
    # nodes have different types, an different purposes:
    #
    # Instances
    #
    # Note that while the source and db nodes will have single containers,
    # the www and fpm nodes will run somewhere between 3 and 9 containers
    # The www and fpm containers will try to correspond their links, but
    # all fpm containers will connect to the same DB and source containers

    # A volume container to hold source
    #
    # Using a conmtainer to hold source, even if it just locally binded source, is
    # a good idea, because it replicates what a production service would do.  It would
    # have source copied/exported/retrieved in, and make it available in the same way
