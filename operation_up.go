Coach will attempt to get all nodes operational and running.

The run operation follows the following steps:
- build any images for targets with build settings
- pull any required images for targets without build settings
- create new containers for all targets
- start any containers that should be started

This operation is used to allow users to take a coach project
from beginning to fully operational, with a single command.

SYNTAX:
	$/> coach {target} up

	{targets} what target node instances the operation should process ($/> coach help targets)

TODO:
	- building images may take a long time, so maybe it should be optional;
	- pulling images may take a long time, so maybe it should be optional;
	- perhaps check if containers exist before creating them;
	- perhaps check if contaienrs are running before starting them.
