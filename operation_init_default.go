# The coach app folder

The purpose of this folder is to keep all of the project elements that in a single location,
in a manner that maps easily into the wunder-base approach.  This approach is meant to keep
all source code mapped well into the containers, for both path and ownership.

## WWW

The www folder is meant to house the htdocs parts of the apllication.  This gives a render/make
target for application source code, into which it can be linked or copied.  This allows separation
of project custom code, from community code for frameworks and libraries.

## Assets

The assets folder is meant to be a non-versioned folder that contains elements needed to
run the application, but which should not be a part of the project source code.  This includes
file assets, and cache elements and temprorary elements.
The real goal of this folder is to separate filespace into Read-Only and Writeable, with the
Assets folder being the writeable.
