    # COACH DEMO: Standard Lamp

    This coach demo provides a standard LAMP stack:

    - Nginx service using jamesnesbitt/wunder-nginx
    - PHP-FPM service using jamesnesbitt/wunder-php56fpm
    - DB service using jamesnesbitt/wunder-mariadb

    To incorporate source, the source code from /app/source
    is mapped into a "source" container, which is used in
    the nginx and fpm containers.

    The Database is un-initialized, but an optional init
    build for a db has been included, and you can switch to
    it by removing the db node, and uncommenting the custom
    db node.

    All of the suggested images in this project are based on
    the wunder-base concept, which is used to provide a commong
    /app project folder, and similar users/OS, to keep access
    privileges working better.
    The builds are all CentOS7, EPEL and often REMI based builds.

    # Getting Started:

      You already did this:

        #/> coach init demo lampstack

      Now just do this:

        $/> coach up

      This should:

        - download some images
        - build any local images that were defined
        - create a source container which will map ./app/source to /app/www/active

        - start an nginx container, and fpm container and a db container

      You should then have

        - http access at host:8080, or directly on the container
        - the http should point to the source code in /app/source

    # Day to day use

    ## starting and stopping

        $/> coach stop
        $/> coach start

    ## starting a specific container

      - start a specific node

        $/> coach @www start

      - start all service nodes

        $/> coach %service start

    ## rebuild any containers

      1. stop any running containers

        $/> coach stop

      2. remove and created containers

        $/> coach remove

      3. recreate and containers

        $/> coach create

      4. start the new containers

        $/> coach start

    # Alterations that you should make

    ## Custom DB

    The nodes.yml file has a better DB image commented out which you could use to get
    a DB container that has an already populated DB with specific access credentials.

    ## Switch to PHP7 or HHVM

    If you want to test out the latest PHP7 or HHVM builds, try changing nodes.yml, the
    fpm node Image values.  There are instructions above the node.

    Note that if you want to swap out fpm containers, you will need to stop and remove
    both the fpm and nginx nodes, alter the nodes yml, and then start www and fpm again
    (you do not need to stop the db container.)

    Instructions:

    1. Make changes to your nodes.yml (change the fpm image)

    2. stop www and fpm

      $/> coach @fpm @www stop

    3. remove www and fpm containers

      $/> coach @fpm @www remove

    4. make sure that you have all needed images

      $/> coach pull
      $/> coach build

    5. re-create www and fpm containers

      $/> coach @fpm @www recreate

    6. restart www and fpm containers

      $/> coach @fpm @www start

    ###
    # Project nodes
    #
    # A string map of node configurations, each entry is a node, which 
    # corresponds to a set of containers based on a single image.  the
    # nodes have different types, an different purposes:
    #
    # Nodes: 
    #   Each element in the yml file is a keyed configuration to configure
    #   a single coach node, which is any number of docker containers
    #   that use a single build/image.  The nodes can be just used to 
    #   build images, or can be used to store data, run services or run
    #   commands.  A node can use multiple containers to provide scaling
    #   services, or alternate services.
    #
    # Types:
    #   - build: only used for building images, let's you build a base 
    #        image for other nodes
    #   - volume: non-running containers meant to hold files that are 
    #        shared with other nodes
    #   - service: a node with containers that get started and stopped
    #   - command: a node that uses disposable containers to run commands
    #        inside an environment
    #
    # Instances:
    #   Nodes can have multiple containers called instances. The instances
    #   setting tells coach how to treat the node instances:
    #   - scale: allow numeric instances, and allow the scale operation 
    #        to spin up new instanes.
    #   - fixed: if you provide a string list of instances, then they 
    #         can be started and stopped by name.
    #   - temporary: instances started are removed when stopped.  For example
    #         command containers are considered temporary.
    #
    #   Multiple instances are complex, especially when it comes to linking
    #   Nodes together.  If one node is linked to another, either by Link,
    #   or VolumesFrom, then coach tries to link matching instance names
    #   possible (or you can user node:all to link to all)
    #
    # Tokens:
    #
    #  Tokens can be used for string substitution in this file.  Tokens can come
    #  from the conf.yml, or from the secrets.yml (or from the users secrets.)
    #  Tokens are substituted using a "%" prefix, before the YML is parsed, so
    #  you may need to wrap tokenized settings in "quotes" when using them.
    #
    #  The following tokens are available:
    #
    #    - anything from the tokens section of the conf.yml
    #    - anything from the project or user secrets.yml
    #    
    #    - the project name is accessible using %PROJECT
    #    - any path value is accessible using %PATH_UPPERCASEPATHKEY
    #    - multi-instance nodes can access the intance name as %INSTANCE
    #
    # Coach configuration:
    #
    #   - Type: You can define the node type (or it will default to service)
    #   - Build: You can assign a Build path, which will be used to build a local
    #        image for the node.  If you also define an image then that
    #        is used for the image name.  If the path is relative, then it
    #        is considered relative inside the .coach/ folder.
    #   - Instances: a string list of instance names, or the keyword temporary
    #        or the keyword scaled, followed by the integer values for initial
    #        and maximum number of running containers
    #        e.g.:
    #           Instances: first second third
    #           Instances: temporary
    #           Instances: scaled 3 9
    #
    # Docker remote API Configurations:
    #
    #   The two principle parts of the configuration for a node are the 
    #   Config and Host settings.
    #   These wrap the client config and can use any of it's keys, which 
    #   gives access to pretty much all of the docker remote API settings.
    #
    #   - Config : the dockerclient config element used define the internals
    #        of a container.  
    #        https://github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/blob/master/container.go#L200
    #   - Host : the dockerclient config element used to define the relationship
    #        between the container and it's host.
    #        https://github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/blob/master/container.go#L472

    ###
    # A volume container to hold source
    #
    # Using a conmtainer to hold source, even if it just locally binded source, is
    # a good idea, because it replicates what a production service would do.  It would
    # have source copied/exported/retrieved in, and make it available in the same way
    #
    source:
      Type: volume

      Config:
        Image: jamesnesbitt/wunder-base # RUn from a standard base image
      Host:
        Binds:
          - "app/source:/app/www/active" # map the local source folder, into where the nginx/fpm expect the web root

    ###
    # Database service
    #
    # This container is a base DB image with no existing DB, nor access.  Consider 
    # using a local build, to extend a base DB image, adding in a db, adding a user
    # and setting exactly what access credentials that you want
    #
    db:
      Type: service

      Config:
        Image: jamesnesbitt/wunder-mariadb  # this base db image has no running db, user, access yet

    ###
    # Alternative Custom Database service
    #
    # This container uses a local build to extend a base db, adding in a database "app" and changing
    # the root user password
    # 
    # @see ./coach/docker/db/Dockerfile
    #
    # This node needs building !  $/> coach build
    #

    # db:
    #   Type: service
    #   Build: /docker/db          # DB has a docker build so that we can create databases and set custom passwords.

    #     RestartPolicy: on-failure
    #     OpenStdin: true

    ###
    # FPM service
    #
    # This node implements a standard PHP-FPM service, which you can connect to over
    # TCP/IP.  The node has access to the source via the source container, and the db
    # using a docker link (accessible over TCP/IP at db.app)
    #
    # There are alternative PHP images that you could try, to test out HHVM or PHP7
    # But note that if you switch, you have to recreate the container.
    #
    # Note that the WWW node needs this container

        #Image: jamesnesbitt/wunder-hhvm      # The HHVM works
        Image: jamesnesbitt/wunder-php56fpm     # The FPM works, and should have blackfire working
        #Image: jamesnesbitt/wunder-php7fpm     # The FPM delivers the latest PHP7

    ###
    # WWW service
    #
    # An nginx service, that handles http requests, and passes PHP parsing off to 
    # the fpm node.  This node has some custom configurations to try to get it
    # to respond to different URLs appropriately
    #
    # @note that this container binds to the host port for 8080, but can still be 
    #   resolved by pointing to port 80 on the container IP
    # @note that if you are using DNSDOCK, the DNSDOCK_ALIAS will help you browser to the service
    # @note https is an option if you set up the image properly.

    # DB Docker Build

    This is a Docker build that can optionally be used for building a custom Database
    image for the local project.

    To use this build, add "docker/db" (the path inside the .coach folder) to an node,
    and then you can use "$/> docker build" to build all node images
