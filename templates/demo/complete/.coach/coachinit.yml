    # .coach

    This folder keeps settings and scripts for use with coach.  This folder
    demarks the root of the project, and allows the coach CLI to be run at
    any child path.  The folder is usually kept next to a source tree in order
    to allow git separation, or encapsulation, where desired.

    ## configuring coach

    ### conf.yml

    Base coach configuration, defining the project name (used to name containers)
    , configure the docker client, add any custom paths that you may want to use
    and to declare initial tokens

    ### secrets/secrets/yml

    This YAML file contains additional tokens, loaded after the conf.yml tokens
    are added, to allow sensitive tokens to be kept out of any git repository.
    The file could be shared as an example.secrets.yml in repository.

    Not demonstrated in this demo, is that if you have a file in your home directory
    ~/.coach/secrets/secrets.yml, then those tokens are loaded after these tokens
    to allow user overrides.

    ### nodes.yml

    A map of nodes which coach will run.

    ### tools.yml

    A map of non-coach tools, usually scripts, that coach can try to run for you.

    This allows for running of scripts from anywhere in the project, and allows
    passing in coach tokens as ENV variables.

    This accomodates the need to allow simple scripting integration, where writing
    custom operations does not make sense.

    ### help.yml

    A map of custom help topics, that could be accessed using $/> coach help {token}

    ### docker/{build}

    An optional path that can be used to keep Docker builds that should be built
    automatically as a part of a node.  To use one of these, there must be a node
    that declares Build: docker/{build}

    # Project nodes
    #
    # A string map of node configurations, each entry is a node, which 
    # corresponds to a set of containers based on a single image.  the
    # nodes have different types, an different purposes:
    #
    # Nodes: 
    #   Each element in the yml file is a keyed configuration to configure
    #   a single coach node, which is any number of docker containers
    #   that use a single build/image.  The nodes can be just used to 
    #   build images, or can be used to store data, run services or run
    #   commands.  A node can use multiple containers to provide scaling
    #   services, or alternate services.
    #
    # Types:
    #   - build: only used for building images, let's you build a base 
    #        image for other nodes
    #   - volume: non-running containers meant to hold files that are 
    #        shared with other nodes
    #   - service: a node with containers that get started and stopped
    #   - command: a node that uses disposable containers to run commands
    #        inside an environment
    #
    # Instances:
    #   Nodes can have multiple containers called instances. The instances
    #   setting tells coach how to treat the node instances:
    #   - scale: allow numeric instances, and allow the scale operation 
    #        to spin up new instanes.
    #   - fixed: if you provide a string list of instances, then they 
    #         can be started and stopped by name.
    #   - temporary: instances started are removed when stopped.  For example
    #         command containers are considered temporary.
    #
    #   Multiple instances are complex, especially when it comes to linking
    #   Nodes together.  If one node is linked to another, either by Link,
    #   or VolumesFrom, then coach tries to link matching instance names
    #   possible (or you can user node:all to link to all)
    #
    # Tokens:
    #
    #  Tokens can be used for string substitution in this file.  Tokens can come
    #  from the conf.yml, or from the secrets.yml (or from the users secrets.)
    #  Tokens are substituted using a "%" prefix, before the YML is parsed, so
    #  you may need to wrap tokenized settings in "quotes" when using them.
    #
    #  The following tokens are available:
    #
    #    - anything from the tokens section of the conf.yml
    #    - anything from the project or user secrets.yml
    #    
    #    - the project name is accessible using %PROJECT
    #    - any path value is accessible using %PATH_UPPERCASEPATHKEY
    #    - multi-instance nodes can access the intance name as %INSTANCE
    #
    # Coach configuration:
    #
    #   - Type: You can define the node type (or it will default to service)
    #   - Build: You can assign a Build path, which will be used to build a local
    #        image for the node.  If you also define an image then that
    #        is used for the image name.  If the path is relative, then it
    #        is considered relative inside the .coach/ folder.
    #   - Instances: a string list of instance names, or the keyword temporary
    #        or the keyword scaled, followed by the integer values for initial
    #        and maximum number of running containers
    #        e.g.:
    #           Instances: first second third
    #           Instances: temporary
    #           Instances: scaled 3 9
    #
    # Docker remote API Configurations:
    #
    #   The two principle parts of the configuration for a node are the 
    #   Config and Host settings.
    #   These wrap the client config and can use any of it's keys, which 
    #   gives access to pretty much all of the docker remote API settings.
    #
    #   - Config : the dockerclient config element used define the internals
    #        of a container.  
    #        https://github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/blob/master/container.go#L200
    #   - Host : the dockerclient config element used to define the relationship
    #        between the container and it's host.
    #        https://github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/blob/master/container.go#L472

    # A volume container to hold the web root
    #
    # Using a container to hold source, even if it just locally binded source, is
    # a good idea, because it replicates what a production service would do.  It would
    # have source copied/exported/retrieved in, and make it available in the same way
    #
    # The container has
    #  - www : the Read-Only web root (not yet read only)
    #  - assets : a Read-Write set of assets for the application
    #  - backup : a place for the application to dump archives and backups
    #
    # @note that the relational path between the bound paths remains the same
    #  inside the container as it is locally, which allows for relative sym-links

      HELP: Script: shell

      The shell tool is a script based docker run, which often behaves
      better than running terminal applications through the docker remote
      API.

      This script runs the jamesnesbitt/wunder-developershell image, and
      links to all needed services, and pulls volumes as needed.

      The image the runs a zsh shell, using the "app" user, to prevent any
      permission issues.

    ## /app/www

    The final web root to be used by most of the containers.

    This gives a source build destination, as a subfolder to
    a bound path, which can be deleted, copied and moved as a
    part of any source build process.

    This separates writeable source into elements that an be
    considered read-only, which are used in the nginx and
    fpm service.

    ## /app/source

    This folder contains any source files and scripts which
    you may use to build your www path.
    The build process may be run outside of the coach containers
    (in which case there is no need to map it in) or it can
    be mapped in, only to containers that build source.


    ## /app/assets

    This mapped folder contains all writeable assets that need
    to be integrated into your application. This folder allows
    us to mount the www folder as read-only, in served cases,
    for extra security


    ## /app/backup

    An additional writeable path, into which the application
    could archive and backup data.

    # DB Docker Build

    This is a Docker build that can optionally be used for building a custom Database
    image for the local project.

    To use this build, add "docker/db" (the path inside the .coach folder) to an node,
    and then you can use "$/> docker build" to build all node images
