# Coach project conf
#
# Configurations for the coach project
#
# Project: project name, used to create container names
# Author: used for docker commits & pushes.
#   @note this needs to be valid for container names/images
#     so it can contain alpha-numeric & "_"
#
# Tokens: a string map for string substitutions elsewhere
#    by using the format %{key} in files loaded after this
#    one
#
# Paths: a string map of paths that you can use for 
#    things like docker builds and mounts.  Paths can be 
#    absolute or relative to the project root.
#    Note that you can override the following paths:
#      - usertemplates : path to users init templates
#      - usersecrets : path to user secrets
#      - projectsecrets : path to project secrets
#      - build : path to builds
#    Paths are also made available as tokens using the
#    format PATH_{UPPERCASEKEY}
#

# Project name
Project: complete

# if you are going to make docker commits, set this
Author: my.email@docker.com

# Do you use a remote docker service?
#
# @note that file binds don't work in remote docker
# services, all of your images have to build source 
# into the image.
#
#Docker:
#  Host: "tcp://192.168.72.8:4243"

# Some additional settings
Settings:

  # this makes all user env variables available as tokens
  UseEnvVariablesAsTokens: TRUE

# Custom Tokens
Tokens:
  # A custom token that I may want to use inside the containers
  INTERNAL_PROJECT_ID: Akkare3Rqr3

  # these tokens may hold sensitive data, so maybe you should put them
  # into .coach/secrets/secrets.yml instead of here
  BLACKFIRE_SERVER_ID: "{ID}"             # Replace {ID} with your actual ID
  BLACKFIRE_SERVER_TOKEN: "{TOKEN}"       # Replace {TOKEN} with your actual token

  # Set a container domain, which containers can pull in as ENV or box domains
  CONTAINER_DOMAIN: demo.coach
