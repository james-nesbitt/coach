# tools.yml : project tools
#
# List tools, usually shell scripts, which coach can run.
#
# Using coach to run scripts has 2 advantages:
#  1. you can run coach in any subfolder of the project
#  2. you can pass tokens to the script as ENV variables
#
# @NOTE that you can have tools for a user in ~/.coach/tools.yml

###
# shell run
#
# This tool runs docker as a shell script, which gives better ansi
# behaviour than running it through the remote docker API.
# Running the script as a tool allows passing of token information
# to the script.
#
# @note this script is a bit hackish, but works quite well
#

# This tool is a script
